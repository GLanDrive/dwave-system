    Begin using reno for changelog.

    We began using `Reno <https://docs.openstack.org/reno/>`_ as a changelog
    tool after the release of 1.32.0.
    Content added before that release is not included.
    See `releases <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-system/releases>`_
    for previous release notes.
